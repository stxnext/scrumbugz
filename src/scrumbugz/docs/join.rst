Want to help?
=============

Here are things we need help with:

* **fixing bugs listed in the issue tracker**

* **writing tests**

* **writing documentation**: We could use help writing deployment
  documentation for deploying Scrumbugz in other environments.

* **spreading the word**: Do you know other people who would like this
  software? If so, tell them about Scrumbugz!

* **project infrastructure**: Is there infrastructure that's missing
  in this project that would make it easier for you to collaborate? If
  so, what?


Are you thinking, "That's a daunting list!" That's ok! Hop on IRC, say
hi and we can go from there!
